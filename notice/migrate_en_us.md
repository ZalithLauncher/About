<h2 align="center">Instructions for Migrating the Zalith Launcher Project</h2>

The Zalith Launcher project will be migrated from its original location at [MovTery/ZalithLauncher](https://github.com/MovTery/ZalithLauncher) to this organization!

### Reasons:
- Zalith Launcher has now grown into a larger-scale project, requiring a more professional and structured management environment. Therefore, it will be migrated to a separate organizational account.
- I hope to unify the management of some content related to Zalith Launcher in one place, rather than having it all scattered under my personal account. This will facilitate future development.
- Currently, I am the sole main developer of Zalith Launcher. Given my current capabilities, I do not believe I can sustainably maintain it indefinitely. By migrating it to an organizational account, it may be easier to bring in senior developers for collaborative development (if possible).

### Migration Details:
- **Original Project Handling**: After the migration, the original project, [MovTery/ZalithLauncher](https://github.com/MovTery/ZalithLauncher), will be archived but not deleted. An archived status means the project will become read-only and will no longer accept new contributions or updates.
- **Update Source Switch**: Following the migration, new version updates will be based on the new repository within the organization. The update source for old versions will remain in the original repository, but users are encouraged to switch to the new repository as soon as possible to receive the latest updates and support.
- **Primary Developer**: Post-migration, I will continue to be the primary developer of Zalith Launcher. However, the organizational account will allow for inviting more developers to join and collaborate on the project.
