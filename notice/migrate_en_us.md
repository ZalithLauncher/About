<h2 align="center">Instructions for Migrating the Zalith Launcher Project</h2>

The Zalith Launcher project has been migrated from its original location at [MovTery/ZalithLauncher](https://github.com/MovTery/ZalithLauncher) to this organization!

### Reasons:
- Zalith Launcher has now grown into a larger-scale project, requiring a more professional and structured management environment. Therefore, it will be migrated to a separate organizational account.
- I hope to unify the management of some content related to Zalith Launcher in one place, rather than having it all scattered under my personal account. This will facilitate future development.
- Currently, I am the sole main developer of Zalith Launcher. Given my current capabilities, I do not believe I can sustainably maintain it indefinitely. By migrating it to an organizational account, it may be easier to bring in senior developers for collaborative development (if possible).
